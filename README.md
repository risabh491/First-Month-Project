# First-Month-Project
I designed and built a CAPM-based analytics tool that helps in understanding the relationship between expected returns and market risk for various assets. I used Python, Streamlit, and time series data from financial markets to:

📈 Perform trend analysis on stock prices
📊 Visualize asset volatility & beta coefficients
💡 Estimate returns using the CAPM formula
🧠 Integrate predictive components for smarter insights

🌐 The app features a clean user interface, interactive plots, and real-time data insights—perfect for investors, students, and finance professionals

🔧 Tech Stack:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, yfinance)

Streamlit (for rapid web deployment)

Time Series Data (daily adjusted returns)
